### **Understanding Communication in Groups and Teams**:

- Each group has a **distinct goal** and serves different purposes (social, personal growth, or task-related).

  - **Personal growth groups**: Focused on individual development.
  - **Task groups**: Formed to achieve a specific objective.

### **Three Kinds of Communication in Groups**:

1. **Climate Communication**: Focuses on creating and maintaining a supportive environment. `Ex. In response to Brian’s suggestion during a team meeting, Virginia says, “I agree with Brian’s suggestion about how we should proceed. Thanks for keeping us on track, Brian.”`
2. **Procedural Communication**: Guides how the group functions and makes decisions. `Ex. Brian says in his work team, “I think we need to finish talking about the history of this issue before we get into possible solutions.”`
3. **Task Communication**: Deals with sharing information and ideas related to the group’s goal. `Ex. Shiv says during his group meeting, “That’s not how I see it. I think the research indicates that the market is pretty stable, but there are new competing products.” `

### **Defining Groups and Teams**:

- **Group**: Consists of 3 or more people who interact, are interdependent, share a common goal, and follow certain rules. `Ex. Three or more people who interact over time, depend on  one another, and follow shared rules of conduct to reach a **common goal**. In some  instances, individual members’ goals are in tension with the collective goal, but a **common goal** still exists. One value of groups is that they are generally **more creative** than individuals.`

- **Team**: A specialized group where members bring **complementary skills** and share a strong sense of collective identity. `Ex. A special kind of group characterized by different and complementary resources of members and by a strong sense of collective identity. Ex. Like all groups, teams involve interaction, interdependence, shared rules, and **common goals**.`

### **The Rise of Groups and Teams**:

- Common types of professional groups include:
  - **Project teams**
  - **Focus groups**
  - **Brainstorming groups** `Ex.The goal of  brainstorming is to come up with **as many ideas as possible**. Because criticism tends to stifle creativity, brainstorming  groups bar criticism and encourage imaginative, even wild,  thinking.`
  - **Advisory groups**
  - **Quality Improvement Teams**
  - **Decision-making groups**

### **Potential Limitations of Groups**:

1. **Time-Consuming**: Group discussions can take longer than individual decisions.
2. **Conformity**: The pressure to conform can suppress individual opinions and creativity.
3. **Social Loafing**: Some group members may contribute less, relying on others to carry the workload.
   `Ex. The most significant potential disadvantages of group discussion as listed in the text are; conformity pressures, time required and under-participation.`

### **Features of Small Groups**:

- **Cohesion**: The bond that holds the group together. `Ex. The degree of closeness among group members and a sense of group spirit` Overly strong cohesion can lead to **groupthink**, where members prioritize harmony over critical thinking.`Ex.

2. **Coercive Power**: Ability to punish.
3. **Legitimate Power**: Power due to a position or role.
4. **Expert Power**: Power from knowledge or expertise.
