### **Key Theories and Concepts**:

#### **Marshall McLuhan**:

- A communication scholar who argued that **media shapes human life**.
- Famous for saying, "**The medium is the message**."
- He identified four epochs of communication history:
  1. **The Tribal Epoch**: Oral tradition through stories and rituals. `Ex. During the tribal epoch, the dominant sense was hearing.`
  2. **The Literate Epoch**: Written communication via the phonetic alphabet, limited to elites. `Ex. During the literate epoch, the dominant sense was sight` `Ex. The invention of the phonetic alphabet ushered in the Literate Epoch in many societies.`
  3. **The Print Epoch**: Gutenberg’s printing press made books accessible to the masses.
  4. **The Electronic Epoch**: The telegraph, TV, radio, and computers create a "global village." `Ex. Increased access to information made possible by electronic communication that links people all over the world creating a modern world-wide community is known as Global Village` `Ex. The Electronic Epoch in McLuhan’s review of human history began with the telegraph.`

#### **Uses & Gratifications Theory**:

- People use mass media to **gratify personal needs**.
  `Ex. Janis loved watching TV. She really liked to get into shows so that she could forget the problems she was facing.`
- If existing media don't satisfy them, people will create new forms of media to meet those needs.
  `Ex. After a heavy session of studying for final exams, Barbara and Lynn wish to relax for a few hours. Feeling melancholy and in the mood for escapist romanticism, they rent the video Titanic. The choice of media content Barbara and Lynn made reflect uses and gratification`

#### **Agenda Setting Theory**:

- Mass media shapes public focus by:
  1. **Directing attention** to certain topics through extensive coverage.
  2. **Minimizing attention** on others by offering minimal coverage.
- Media acts as a **gatekeeper**, influencing what we think about.
  `Ex. The more coverage an issue receives in the media, the more likely it is to be perceived as important by the public.`

#### **Cultivation Theory**:

`Ex. Heavy television viewers are more likely to have beliefs that reflect the worldview portrayed by television, which is not equivalent to reality. In television entertainment programming, 77% of major characters that commit crimes perpetrate acts of violence, compared to roughly 10% of actually reported crimes. This is Cultivation Theory`

`Ex. The mass media theory that claims that television promotes a worldview that is inaccurate but that views may assume reflects real life is known as cultivation theory. Developed by George Gerbner`

- Media's cumulative effect shapes how we view the world.
- Two key concepts:
  1. **Mainstreaming**: Media makes certain views seem desirable or normal. `Ex. Television’s tendency to stabilize and homogenize views within a society in order to create a single allegedly mainstream view is known as mainstreaming.`
  2. **Resonance**: Media experiences align with viewers’ personal experiences.
- **Mean World Syndrome**: Overexposure to violent or negative media leads people to believe the world is more dangerous than it is. `Ex. Mean World Syndrome relates to all of these: cultivation theory, cumulative effects of television viewing, television violence, mainstreaming`

#### **Dominant Ideology**:

- Media often frames narratives to reflect and reinforce dominant social values (e.g., **narrative framing**, **product placement**, and **immersive advertising**).

### **Digital Media and Mass Media**:

- **Mass media** and **digital media** are deeply interconnected.
- Digital platforms have increased media responsiveness and interaction.
- The rise of digital media is changing how we **think**, **relate**, and experience **community**.

### **Developing Media Literacy**:

- **Media literacy** is the ability to critically understand and interact with media content. Here are five steps to develop it:
  1. **Assess media’s influence** on your thoughts and behavior.
  2. **Recognize patterns** in the media you consume.
  3. **Interrogate media messages** actively—don’t accept them at face value.
  4. **Expose yourself to diverse media sources** for a broader perspective.
  5. **Understand your motivations** for engaging with certain media.
     `Ex. Part of having media literacy means being skeptical of what is presented.`

### **Responding Actively to Media**:

- Recognize that media does not offer a complete or unbiased view of reality.
- Be critical of what the media asks you to believe, think, or do, and challenge these views if necessary.
