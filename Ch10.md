### **Relationship Dialectics**:

- **Opposing and continuous tensions** are a normal part of any close relationship. `Ex. The opposing and continuous tensions found in personal relationships`
- Common dialectics:
  1. **Autonomy/Connection**: The tension between the need for independence and the desire for closeness. `Ex. Lisa wants some time alone because she feels a need to get in touch with herself as an individual. However, she also feels the need to share experiences with her partner Bob and cherishes the time they spend together.`
  2. **Novelty/Predictability**: The balance between wanting stability and craving excitement.
  3. **Openness/Closedness**: The tension between sharing and keeping personal information private. `Ex. After a particularly long phone conversation, Tina’s husband asked her what was going on with her sister. Tina said, “Oh, nothing much.” Her husband knew this wasn’t true, but didn’t ask any more questions.`

### **Managing Dialectical Tensions**:

1. **Neutralization**: Finding a middle ground between both needs.
2. **Separation**: Favoring one need at different times.
3. **Segmentation**: Prioritizing certain needs in specific contexts.
